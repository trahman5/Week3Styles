<p class="summary">Overall, Minecraft is a wonderful yet great game that is very fun for anyone and that to also to be able to expand people's creativity, while yet for the game to be so calm and simple which what really made it stand out. And that to me I used to play this growing up as a kid and it brings out the nostalgia which I very much enjoy.</p>
